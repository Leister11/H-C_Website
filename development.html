						<p>One of my favorite aspects of web development is the unending opportunity for growth. The only limit on what you can do is how much you want to learn and how hard you want to work. For every new language, skill, workflow, or concept I learn, my interest and curiosity for the subject grows even more.

							<dt>Languages</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS and can utilize them to create websites, or customize existing templates. I am always learning something new about HTML and especially CSS as well as searching for ways to optimize workflows and processes.  I am highly organized and believe that all code should be clean, simple, and well documented. I have read introductory material on JavaScript and look forward to exploring the language more as well as applying it to personal and professional projects. Once I am more comfortable and confident with these, I am interested in learning frameworks, libraries, and server side languages. 

							</dd>
							<dt>WordPress</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>I do not have any hands on experience with WordPress, however, I have watched many tutorials and read introductory documentation on PHP, MySQL, popular themes, and I am confident in my ability to learn this content management system. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Version Control</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>I have basic understanding of version control best practices using Git, and GitHub. I am able to use basic Git commands in the terminal as well as leave clear, informative comments for myself and other users. In the creation of this website I utilized version control best practices to ensure smooth and efficient workflows.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Operating Systems and File Management</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>I am familiar with Windows as well as Linux based operating systems. For day-to-day use I prefer Windows and for programming I run the Linux based distro “Xubuntu” on an Oracle Virtual Machine. I can perform basic terminal commands to manage and manipulate file systems, as well as navigate GUI’s. I have never used a Mac os but I have complete confidence that I will learn it quickly if needed. 
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Editing Software and Developer Tools</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>My preferred code editor is Visual Studio Code. However, I am always open to learning other software. I have basic understanding of developer tools within Chrome and Firefox and am excited for opportunities to learn more. </p>
