								<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
								<p>And more specifically, hello Red Razor Marketing!</p>
							</header>
							<p>Hi! My name is Josh and I am a junior front-end web developer. I have also worked as a greenskeeper, a server, a tax advisor, and most recently,
								as a claims analyst working with the automation team of an insurance company. I have lived in Greenville all my life and attended 
								North Greenville University on an academic scholarship, seeking a degree in accounting. I made the transition from accounting to web 
								development because I wanted my career and my work to reflect who I am. I am a highly analytical, self-motivated, creative, passionate, 
								hard working, team player with a “can-do” attitude. I love learning how businesses operate, and more importantly, how I can help them grow 
								online.

								<dt>Skills and Mindset</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>I have many characteristics and skills that assist me in my work as a developer. This includes skills such as problem solving,
										 teachability, communication, teamwork, creativity, and many others. In addition to these, one of my favorite characteristics 
										 is my passion for learning and growing. To me, this is my greatest skill. It allows me to simultaneously increase my abilities
										  in all of my other skills. As I ask questions, read, and learn about web development, my abilities to solve problems become 
										  faster and more efficient. As I learn about my clients and colleagues, I am able to communicate with them more effectively. 
										  As I become more confident in my technical abilities, my creativity will be able to work more freely. I love learning new 
										  things and growing as a web professional and as a person. My mindset is to learn everything I can from people and resources 
										  available to me. To be confident in my abilities, but humble and receptive to advice, instruction, and optimization. I am always
										   looking for ways to optimize my workflows and processes.

								<dt>Interests and Hobbies</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>As far as my interests go, I’m pretty all over the place. From web development and environmental conservation, to rock climbing
										 and baking, my interests have a wide range and I feel like I find a new one everyday. As for consistent hobbies, I regularly
										  do yoga, weight training, hiking, baking, and ultimate frisbee.

							<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my online resume. I am confident and hopeful that by the time you finish reviewing my website you will
								 have come to the conclusion that I am the perfect fit for Red Razor. This confidence is based not only on my abilities, but more importantly,
								  my attitude and mindset. I believe that Red Razor values honesty, hard work, teachability, and creativity. These are the values that caught
								   my eye, because they align with who I am and who I strive to be. I am young and don’t have decades of experience in web development and
									marketing. But I am honest, hard working, teachable, and creative. I view my inexperience as a positive. As an opportunity to apply my 
									existing skills while being humble, teachable, and passionate about what I do and how I serve my clients and colleagues. 
									This is why I believe I am the perfect fit for Red Razor. And I hope you agree!
							</p>

								<br>
							<p>
								The next few pages of this website are meant to showcase my existing knowledge and skills regarding web development, marketing, and editing.
								 I look forward to utilizing them as I learn, optimize, and develop with Red Razor Marketing.
