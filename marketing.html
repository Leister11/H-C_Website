						<p>Just like web development, web marketing is incredibly interesting to me because of its depth and complexity. There’s always the opportunity to learn new strategies, optimize old ones, and stay up to date on the ever changing world of online marketing.

                                <p>Search Engine Optimization is one of the most important tools a business can use to gain organic growth online. Creating a website that is optimized for Google and Bing is no simple task, as it involves a host of factors including, but not limited to, researching markets and competitors, keywords, clean code, relevant and well structured content, as well as what other pages link to your site. For law firms, this can be an even more complex task based on the amount of competition in the market. One of my favorite resources for SEO development is Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en" target="_blank">SEO Starter Guide</a> 
                                <br>This website was made with SEO best practices in mind and I am always looking to gain a deeper understanding of SEO concepts and techniques.

								<p>Pay-Per-Click advertising campaigns can be incredibly successful if done right. With the proper research, tools, and strategy, PPC campaigns will convert searches to clicks, conversions, and clients. I am incredibly interested in learning the ins and outs of this strategy, from start to finish.

								<p>Google offers so many ways for businesses to reach new clients and monitor a campaign's success. Learning these tools is a priority for me, to further my expertise and ability to serve clients and my colleagues.
